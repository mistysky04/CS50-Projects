# CS50-Projects
Completed projects from Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course

Certain projects had pre-prepared code to aid students with the completion of the project.
This includes "Filter-less" in which the student-done code was specifically in the "Helpers.h" file.
However, the majority (if not all) of the work in each file was done by the students themselves.

It is important to note that these projects were done on CS50's codespace utilizing a cloud-based version of VS Code.
This made it easier for students to access a large variety of C libraries without needing to do extensive installation.
As a result, running any of this code on a local computer may require some extra steps to install the respective libraries locally.
